For LinkedIn course React: Testing and Debugging
Created using Create React App.

## Scripts

- "start" - compile and serve development build to [localhost](http://localhost:3000/)

- "build" - create a production build

- "test" - runs Jest test scripts.  If a component change alters the rendered output, the snapshot test will fail - in this case confirm the new component is correct, and if so update the snapshot using 'u' command in Jest CLI

- "coverage" - run Jest --coverage to report on test coverage
